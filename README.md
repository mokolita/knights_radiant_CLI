# KnightsRadiant

Welcome to your new Knights Radiant Gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/knights_radiant`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/run` for an interactive prompt that will help you discover the Order of the Knights Radiant you would belong to. This program is based off of the information provided in Brandon Sanderson's books from "The Stormlight Archives". 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'knights_radiant'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install knights_radiant

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
